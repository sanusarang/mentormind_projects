# MentorMind Project

## Project Title: Heart Disease Analysis

### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing various health factors related to heart disease using a dataset provided by MentorMind. The goal is to explore the relationships between conditions like high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle habits with the occurrence of heart disease. The project uses Python for data analysis and visualization.

### Dataset
- The dataset used for this project contains several health-related features, including:
  - **Heart Disease**: Whether an individual has heart disease (Yes/No).
  - **HighBP**: Indicates if an individual has high blood pressure.
  - **HighChol**: Indicates if an individual has high cholesterol.
  - **Diabetes**: Categorized as:
    - 0: No diabetes
    - 1: Pre-diabetes
    - 2: Diabetes
  - **Other Factors**: Stroke, smoking status, physical activity, and more.

### Objectives
1. **Explore Relationships**: Examine how factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, and BMI affect heart disease.
2. **Demographic Analysis**: Investigate the prevalence of heart disease across various demographic groups such as age, gender, and income.
3. **Correlations Between Variables**: Use scatter plots and correlation matrices to explore relationships between continuous variables like BMI and cholesterol.
4. **Visualizations**: Create visual representations of the health conditions and demographic comparisons using Python libraries such as `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib`.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating charts and visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For writing and running the code.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and code hosting.

### Results
- Visualizations showing the distribution of health factors between individuals with and without heart disease.
- Correlation matrices highlighting the relationships between continuous variables such as BMI, age, and cholesterol.
- Demographic breakdowns of heart disease prevalence.
